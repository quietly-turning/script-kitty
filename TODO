MILESTONES:

1. Test, test, test
	is it still possible to crash the app with malformed queries?
		yes, by using the sleep() function
	is it still possible to submit a malicious query?  Needs proper sandboxing.
		it doesn't seem so!

2. More exercises per lesson (10+) in order to facilitate randomization?
	this will require the "My Progress" page to be reworked
	(the least of my worries here, really!)

3. Educator panel
	manage content
		new exercises (provided a question + answer, the rest can be procedurally handled)
	metrics
		by lesson
		by exercise
		by learner

4. Certificate of Completionâ„¢ page
	This would coincide nicely with the "Share your accomplishment to [social media platform]!"

Security Things

Smaller Things

1. Add a proper README documenting how to setup the app from scratch and where to find things within the code.
2. Maybe add an aside concerning versions of SQL?  That this tutorial uses MariaDB?
3. Share accomplishment to [social media platform]?  (This should probably coincide with the wrap-up page.)

Nebulous Things

1. Layout improvements.  This may become more clear as user testing is started.
2. Public-facing interface as a whole needs a review of flow.


---
Abandoned Things?

1. make visual builder quasi-functional
	blocks need to be droppable
	queries need to be create-able
	conditions need to be create-able? (does this matter any longer?)

2. Add lesson-path/progress-bar to top (look into this later, maybe?)
