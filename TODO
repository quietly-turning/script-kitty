MILESTONES:

1. Test, test, test
	is it still possible to crash the app with malformed queries?
	is it still possible to submit a malicious query?  Needs proper sandboxing.


---
Smaller Things

1. Wrap-up/Summary page after completing final exercise.
2. Add a proper README documenting how to setup the app from scratch and where to find things within the code.
3. Maybe add an aside concerning versions of SQL?  That this tutorial uses MariaDB?
4. Have home page direct learner toward the next lesson s/he should work on.
5. Share accomplishment to [social media platform]?  (This should probably coincide with the wrap-up page.)


---
Nebulous Things

1. Layout improvements.  This may become more clear as user testing is started.
2. Public-facing interface as a whole needs a review of flow.


---
Abandoned Things?

1. make visual builder quasi-functional
	blocks need to be droppable
	queries need to be create-able
	conditions need to be create-able? (does this matter any longer?)

2. Add lesson-path/progress-bar to top (look into this later, maybe?)
