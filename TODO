MILESTONES:

1. Test, test, test
	is it still possible to crash the app with malformed queries?
	is it still possible to submit a malicious query?  Needs proper sandboxing.


---
Smaller Things

1. Investigate whether CodeMirror contents can be saved/cached in the event of the learner
	pressing the browser's back button.
2. Wrap-up/Summary page after completing final exercise.
3. Maybe add an aside concerning versions of SQL?  That this tutorial uses MariaDB?
4. Share accomplishment to [social media platform]?


---
Nebulous Things

1. Layout improvements.  This may become more clear as user testing is started.
2. Public-facing interface as a whole needs a review of flow.


---
Abandoned Things?

1. make visual builder quasi-functional
	blocks need to be droppable
	queries need to be create-able
	conditions need to be create-able? (does this matter any longer?)

2. Add lesson-path/progress-bar to top (look into this later, maybe?)
