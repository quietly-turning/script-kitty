MILESTONES:

1. write 8 lessons

2. make visual builder quasi-functional
	blocks need to be droppable
	queries need to be create-able
	conditions need to be create-able? (does this matter any longer?)



3. Test, test, test
	simple interface
		is it still possible to crash the app with malformed queries?
		is it still possible to submit a devious query?

	visual interface

Smaller Things

1. Add lesson-path/progress-bar to top
2. Write more exercises? Two per topic?
3. Query review (simple + visual) should be stylized with markup to emphasize keywords.
4. Simple query editor needs to work from every link that brings you there.

Nebulous Things

1. Find a better way to present the datasets.  This may become more clear as lessons are written.
2. Layout improvements.  This may become more clear as user testing is started.
