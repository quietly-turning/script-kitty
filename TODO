MILESTONES:

1. Test, test, test
	is it still possible to crash the app with malformed queries?
		yes, by using the sleep() function
	is it still possible to submit a malicious query?  Needs proper sandboxing.
		it doesn't seem so!

2. Rewrite Lesson 8 to feature JOIN statement.

Smaller Things

1. Add a proper README documenting how to setup the app from scratch and where to find things within the code.
2. Maybe add an aside concerning versions of SQL?  That this tutorial uses MariaDB?
3. Share accomplishment to [social media platform]?  (This should probably coincide with the wrap-up page.)
4. Alt-Text (on hover) for Exercises

Nebulous Things

1. Layout improvements.  This may become more clear as user testing is started.
2. Public-facing interface as a whole needs a review of flow.


---
Abandoned Things?

1. make visual builder quasi-functional
	blocks need to be droppable
	queries need to be create-able
	conditions need to be create-able? (does this matter any longer?)

2. Add lesson-path/progress-bar to top (look into this later, maybe?)
