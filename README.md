# Script Kitty

Script Kitty is a web app I created for my M.S. research in 2014.

Inspired by Khan Academy's then-new interactive playground to try computer science in a web browser, I saw an opportunity to do the same with relational database querying.

At that time, a few educational resources to try SQL in your web browser did exist, and I strove to improve on them by providing:

* 8 lessons
* over 30 interactive exercises
* beginner-friendly error messages
* a "no code" visual query builder option
* mobile-friendly layout
* a cute mascot with fun narrative throughline ðŸ˜¸
