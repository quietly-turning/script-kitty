## 1.  a simple query

## 2.  a simple query with a single condition
SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE city = "Athens"

# this returns nothing
SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE chief = "stan"

# this returns nothing
SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE chief LIKE "stan"

# this returns 25 rows
SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE chief LIKE "%stan%"

OR institutions.chief LIKE "%Carrol%




## 5.  a query with two conditions chained by "and"
# this returns a single row where the chief is "Laura Carroll"
SELECT *

# this returns a single rural college in Houston, Missouri
SELECT *
FROM institutions
WHERE institutions.city = "Houston"
AND institutions.state != "TX"





## 7.  a query with multiple conditions chained by "and" and "or"



## 8.  a second query with multiple conditions chained by "and" and "or"





## 9. complex query that pulls from multiple tables (and how to avoid cartesian products)
# this returns four unique institutions (coincidentally from four unique states) where the city is "Sterling" 
SELECT institutions.name, institutions.state, controls.name
FROM institutions, controls
WHERE institutions.city = "Sterling"
AND controls.id = institutions.control_id
